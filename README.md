# bioinformatics_course_2022_project
This is the repository for reproducing the results of the 2022 Bioinformatics course project. The project_reproduction branch is the main branch for reproducing the code, the master branch contains the latest experiments.
The Rnotebook is located in the code folder and should be executable within this repository, producing an HTML output report in the code folder and results images in the results folder. The raw data is located in the phosphoproteomics folder.
The code folder contains also an image folder, created by the html creator contianing added pictures for the report.
# Error fixes
1. Set the correct working directory manually if needed, the Rnorebook assumes that one is standing in the phosphoproteomics_project directory.
2. The file dependencies are written for a linux system.
